# TryCodnet Recruitment Task

### Features and technologies used: 
  - React.js library used to build whole UI
  - Routing: Application fetches neceserry data while route change (in header and footer). Also it starts on specific route (/bitcoin). <br>
  - Fetching is being handled by redux-saga package (due to quite big number of async calls and purpose of demonstrate my knowledge about it) <br>
  - State managment is being handled by Redux package
  - Styling is prepared thanks to 2 dependencies: 
    - First: styled-components (JS in CSS) 
    - Second: Sass preprocessor
  - Reusable global variables of theme module 
  - React Hooks insead of traditional class-based components 
  - tests: Jest and Enzyme
